<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
Education: Parsons school of design: Design and tech major
My interests: playing games, cosplay
Job interests: Game designer
my reflection on learning coding: technology is a big part of my daily life, but by learning it I understand how it really works.Coding showed me that technology is something I can create with, not just use.
