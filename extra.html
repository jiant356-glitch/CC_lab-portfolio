<h1>About this class</h1>

<p>
    In this coding class, I learned the basics of p5.js and how code can be used as a creative tool. I learned how to use loops, conditionals, and simple animation to make visual sketches. Coding was challenging at times, but it helped me think more logically and experiment through trial and error.
