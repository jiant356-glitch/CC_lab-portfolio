<h1>Lost and Found</h1>

<p>
The Kamogawa River in Kyoto is my favorite place in Japan. Every time I visit, I ride a bike along the river from dawn to dusk, enjoying the misty mornings, flowing water, temples, tea houses, and quiet everyday life. The calm rhythm of the river, mixed with birdsong, wind, and simple meals, helps me slow down and relax. This kind of travel feels simple but deeply meaningful to me.

  I found it interesting for me to draw a picture by coding, however, the rotation part makes me felt hard, I need to try mutiple times to get what I want.
