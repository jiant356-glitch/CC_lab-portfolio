<h1>Exquisite Corpse</h1>

<p>
Background story: this is a robot, it was created in 3020 year by a collage student for her final project, and accidentally time traveled to 2025. It can show its emotions by punctuations on the screen on its body instead on its face. No other skills that are useful. Sometimes the emotion screen is not accurate.
